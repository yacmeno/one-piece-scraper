# one-piece-scraper
Jaimini's Box is a scanlation website that provides high quality scans of a manga I follow called 'One Piece'.

I made personal webscraping tools to retrieve their latest release in order to have fast access to the reading link. I initially made a CLI program variant with python3, but later created a chrome browser extension. Specifically, the urls to read and download the latest chapter are retrieved.
